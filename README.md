# SegTraj-STGCN
This project proposes SegTraj-STGCN, a framework for social group detection from multi-agent trajectories. It decomposes long trajectories into sub-trajectories and builds a spatio-temporal graph to model direct/indirect interactions. Evaluations on NBA, pedestrian, and simulated data show clear performance gains.
